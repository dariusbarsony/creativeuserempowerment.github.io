# Documentation of Experiments 

Within the framework of Creative User Empowerment, a number of experiments were carried out that briefly provide information and support for the development of the xCurator tool. 
In order to keep the development process transparent, the experiments are presented below.

## 1.	What do developers think? Hackathon x vol. 2 
From 25-27 June 2021, the "Hackathon x Vol. 2" took place as a cooperation between the Badisches Landesmuseum, Allard Pierson Amsterdam and Hack & Söhne. More than 140 people from all over the world took part in the online developer event, which was held under the motto "The Digital Museum" and dealt with challenges on the topics of "Games, Platforms and Artificial Intelligence" and developed creative solutions in 48 hours. Inspiring tech talks and mentoring, online yoga and social gaming on the digital platform Gather.Town accompanied the weekend. Over 20 projects were submitted by 100 people, of which 6 winning projects in 2 sections convinced an interdisciplinary jury. 

### Creative Solutions for Artificial Intelligence in the Museum 
In the section on Artificial Intelligence in the Museum, data sets from the Badisches Landesmuseum and Allard Pierson were made available. The challenge was to develop concepts and applications that use artificial intelligence to make the museum's digital content available to users in a personalised way. 

### The winning projects of the AI Challenge are:
1st prize: Etienne Bührle: William: Chat with William III 
2nd prize: Andrii Strynzha, Raghavendra Vijayanagaram, Fabian Ulmer, Maxim Popov, Nikita Nesterov: Your Guide - Personalize your visit to museum using generated tour based on your interests
3rd prize: Nandakishor M: Image chat conversational AI app for museum arts

### Development Plan 
Following Hackathon x - vol 2-, some teams were invited to continue working on their ideas and concepts at the Development Plan. Two teams took up this challenge:
•	Nandakishor M - with "Image Chat".
•	Richárd Ádám Vécsey & Axel Ország-Krisz - with "Pong".
### Towards Augmented Reality & AI
As a virtual guide in the museum, the project works with an AR audio bot (Blenderbot 2.0) with internet search function and AWS to obtain information about artists or the museum. The chatbot has a long-term memory and the ability to access the internet. It outperforms existing models in terms of longer conversations over multiple sessions and has more knowledge and factual consistency than before, according to reviewers. The model stores the knowledge gathered during the conversation in a long-term memory and uses this experience to have long-term conversations. During the conversation, the model searches the internet by making its own queries, reading the results and taking them into account when formulating an answer.

### About the developer:
Nandakishor is a Udemy Artificial Intelligence teacher and CEO of deepflow technologies Pvt Ltd, a deep tech startup from India. He is an expert in computer vision, NLP, robotics and IoT. www.deepflow.in 

Laudatio:
"The conversational AI based image chat app is an ambitious and timely idea for which there is already a working prototype. Using an image as a conversation starter is a great idea, and the combination of text and image is very promising for providing additional information or recommending other museum objects that are relevant to the user." (Jaap Kamps, University of Amsterdam, member of the jury)

"In the development plan, the project has been steadily and creatively developed, incorporating new features and showing the possibilities of image recognition, voice output and the combination of augmented reality and AI. The highly creative and future-oriented development deserves the prize!" (Sonja Thiel, Project Manager)

### Artwork Recommendation System 
Pong is an AI and ML based artwork recommendation system and makes predictions for artworks based on different approaches. Recommendations are part of our daily lives. From choosing music or movies, to the ideal programme and washing time of washing machines, to the auto-correction service of various messaging apps, we can constantly encounter AI-, ML- or simple algorithm-based recommendation systems. The demo version recommends 27,898 artworks based on 2074 keywords, 7 different colour categories or outputs from AI or ML models. Pong aims to develop a system that is easy to maintain and has a low cost of ownership as it does not need to use any cloud infrastructure or services.

### About the developers:
Dr Ország-Krisz Axel
Axel works as a freelance deep-learning developer, data scientist and career-jumper from law. He believes that artificial intelligence should be accessible to everyone so that people can focus on important things like society and general values instead of dealing with the problems of daily life.

Dr Vécsey Richárd Ádám
Richard works as a freelance deep learning developer and data scientist who switched from law to IT. He enjoys playing with AI to find complicated solutions to simple problems.

Laudatio:
"Pong has taken the idea of recommending artworks further in the Development Plan, and to do so has worked extensively with the museum's data and metadata. Their recommendation system was differentiated in terms of rating systems and options for reaction-based rating and personality-based rating were used. After a warm-up phase, users are suggested artworks based either on colour, content (keywords) or a combination. The critical examination of recommendation algorithms is an important contribution to the future of museums." (Sonja Thiel, project manager)

## 2.	What do young people think? The BWKI Hackathon
The Federal Competition on Artificial Intelligence (BWKI) motivates students to use the tools of artificial intelligence to implement their own ideas for a better world of tomorrow. The national competition was launched in 2018 at the AI research site in Tübingen by the Competence Center for Machine Learning and enables young people to actively demonstrate their skills in the AI research environment. https://bw-ki.de and https://ki-kurs.org.
In 2021 the Baden State Museum cooperated for a hackathon with the BWKI under the motto "Write Code - Write History" and gave out the challenge and the datasets. 
Participants were asked to develop AI applications that will be used in museums of the future to optimize knowledge transfer. The winning project by a 16-year-old student uses augmented reality to bring museum objects to life. The four 17- and 18-year-old students on the "Hyperion" team generated new artworks based on museum data. The winning team was supported by the Badisches Landesmuseum in the continuation of its project idea. Book prizes and participation in various online courses were also awarded to other teams.
"Artificial intelligence is one of the most important and exciting topics of our time, it is a real game changer. In the national AI competition, teenagers and young adults can play an active role in shaping this important topic of the future," explained Minister Theresia Bauer, Chairwoman of the Carl Zeiss Foundation Administration, and patron of the national competition. "Children have curiosity and fun. That makes them ideal researchers and they can live that out at BWKI," said Professor Bernhard Schölkopf, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and one of the initiators of the competition. "It is just great and inspiring to see the creativity, skill and perseverance of the students in this competition. I dream of a society in which we encourage each other much more to develop and try out good ideas," according to Professor Matthias Bethge, co-initiator of the competition and head of the Tübingen AI Center, BMBF Competence Center for Machine Learning.

The winning teams of the hackathon were:  
•	Frege-2, Team LoremIpsum Boris Kantor, kARlsruhe augmented reality of museum content
•	Turing-2, Team Hyperion, AI Art Generator
•	Frege-1, Team Space Poster, Hieroglyphic Translator
•	Lovelance-2, Team Cookiesablehnen
As part of „Creative User Empowerment“, it was a great pleasure to see what children and young people can do with museum data and how creatively and innovatively they use it. The hackathon was another step on the way to making museum data accessible to everyone and opening up creative spaces.
