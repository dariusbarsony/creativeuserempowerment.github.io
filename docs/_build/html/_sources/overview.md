# Overview

The Creative User Empowerment (CUE) project is a partnership between the [Baden State Museum](https://www.landesmuseum.de/museum) and the [Allard Pierson Museum](https://allardpierson.nl/). CUE aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to unlock museum heritage collections via an Open Source tool called xCurator.

## xCurator – The Digital Museum of the Future

With the development of the open-source tool xCurator, AI technologies will not only be able to automatically provide new and personalised access to the museum’s content but also link it to deep external levels of information.

The research and development of xCurator aims to:
– Make use of current technological possibilities;
– Guide digital transformation processes of cultural institutions;
– Stimulate the social discussion and applicability of the phenomenon of AI for heritage.

Using image recognition processes and AI-assisted text production, the museum’s extensive digital collections are made accessible and expanded. A storytelling approach allows users to create their own AI-assisted productions. In this way, an instrument is developed with and for users, with which not only the development and deepening of the context of the museum content, but above all the variety of perspectives and the relevance of one’s own history is developed. In co-creative development environments such as brainstorming sessions, workshops, and hackathons, users and developers together will create the digital museum of the future.

## Calls for Participation in the Project

If you would like to contribute to this project based on your expertise, we would like to hear from you. We are looking for expertise in the fields of machine learning, search engines, recommendation systems, responsible use of AI, big data, data analysis, text mining, ethics, etc. You can participate in the form of thinking along, giving solicited and unsolicited advice, participating in workshops and hackathons, deploying students, testing the application, etc.
