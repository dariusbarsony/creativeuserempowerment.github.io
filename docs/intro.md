# Introduction

Here we will provide a short overview of the website. In this website the content will be discussed. This website was created from a collaboration between Etienne Posthumus (Allard Pierson, AP), Sonja Thiel (Baden State Museum) and Darius Barsony (University of Amsterdam). It explores the possibilities of artificial intelligence and it reports on the proceedings within the Creative User Empowerment (CUE) project. This project aims to unlock cultural heritage collections via an open source tool called xCurator. 

This website consists of the following pages:

There are several pages to this website. The page [](cue.md) provides a deeper dive into what the aims of the CUE project are and what the aim of the xCurator tool is. [](projects.md) gives an overview of some of the projects that have been done over the course of the CUE project. [](data.md) gives an overview of some data from the AP museum. [](notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb) displays the exploration of some of this data. [](ai.md) gives an overview of the artificial intelligence techniques that have proven themselves throughout the CUE project. Then lastly [](misc.md) has some links/references relevant to the project.

Also there was a study done using user reviews that executed some analysis on four separate datasets: the results of this study can be viewed here: [page 1](Clustering%20-%20Dataset%20%231.html), [page 2](assets/Clustering%20-%20Dataset%20%232.html), [page 3](assets/Clustering%20-%20Dataset%20%233.html) and [page 4](assets/Clustering%20-%20Dataset%20%234.html).
