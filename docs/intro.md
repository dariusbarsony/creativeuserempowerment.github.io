This website was created from a collaboration between Etienne Posthumus (Allard Pierson, AP), Sonja Thiel (Baden State Museum) and Darius Barsony (University of Amsterdam). It explores the possibilities of artificial intelligence and it reports on the proceedings within the Creative User Empowerment (CUE) project. This project aims to unlock cultural heritage collections via an open source tool called xCurator.
